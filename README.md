    - returns: true

*Example 2:*
    - input1: "yesterday"
    - input2: "today"
    - returns: false

### Problem 2

    - input1: "racecar"
    - returns: true

*Example 2:*
    - input1: "hello"
    - returns: false

### Problem 3
You've been charged £x.xx for a taxi ride, but you only have a £x note. What is the minimum number of coins the taxi driver can give you?

Reminder that there are only 8 coins in the UK: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2.

*Example 1:*

    - input2: 10
    - returns: 5

*Example 2:*
    - input1: 7.25
    - input2: 15
    - returns: 7

### Problem 4
Given a string, find the number of repeated characters, then return the character with the most repeats. 

If there are no repeats, return the first character. 

If there are multiple characters with the same number of repeats, return the first character with the most repeats.

*Example 1:*
    - input1: "hello world"
    - returns: "l"

*Example 2:*
    - input1: "hacker"
    - returns: "h"

*Examples 3:*
    - input1: "hacknotts"
    - returns: "t"

### Problem 4
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
    - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    - Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

*Example 1:*
    - input1: "()"
    - returns: true

*Example 2:*
    - input1: "([]){()}}"
    - returns: false

### Problem 5
Given an array of integers, return the number of permutations of the array that are in ascending order.

*Example 1:*
    - input1: [1, 2, 3]
    - returns: 6

*Example 2:*
    - input1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    - returns: 24
